            <em>
              I am a very optimistic, fun, and loving person. I always try to
              remain positive regardless of how negative the situation can be.
              My passion for technology started when I was a toddler. I would
              always play games on my phone, computers and consoles. I always
              saw myself pursuing a career in I.T because of my interest in it
              since I was young.</em
